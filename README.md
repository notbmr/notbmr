- 👋 Hi, I’m @notbmr. I'm new to all of this and worried y'all are watching me fumble about on my laptop.
- 👀 I’m interested in figuring this out and confident I will do so in time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at a decent clip for someone with zero experience.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any of you on pretty much anything.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I think it has something to with the button my on my monitor or someething. If you know the trick, feel free to drop by and say hello whevener. I'm happy to be here.
